model that in my code. If need be just put "app" into a git repo, and connect that to netlify instead. Do that until confident with all this.

--------
probably use smaller images - look at tailwind UI for nice component that would fit these

try modelling maggie appletion fonts - https://maggieappleton.com/digital-anthropology. See font directory. Worth doing tutorials to know how to use fints in gatsby with tailwind.
Use a "My story" page to play weith it. Make that page beautiful, and a total pleasure to read. 
--> Like https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/your-stories/how-i-learnt-to-focus-on-self-care
--> find a good tailwind ui template for that
Once have a really nice serif font working, try the nice paper background for quotes cards - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Vt0fEiuhE&t=2s

add testimonials from existing site, e.g. http://perth.co.uk/newsletters/  - look at other charity sites for inspiration
set up sanity previews - video 12: 7:30mins
fix the fade in on my site

--> go live



quotes for my site
You were supposed to sing and dance wuhile the music was being played.
All you have to do is live today really really well.
