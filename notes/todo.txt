Misc fixes
==========
add the lines either side of section headings - like "Latest News" on file:///C:/Users/Stuart/Code/plus/notes/Inspiration/SmartBox.html
put sort into util
Change iPad feature descriptions
Remove right margin on mobile
in mobile footer put elan below plus
try modelling maggie appletion fonts - https://maggieappleton.com/digital-anthropology. See font directory. Worth doing tutorials to know how to use fints in gatsby with tailwind.
Use a "My story" page to play weith it. Make that page beautiful, and a total pleasure to read. 
--> Like https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/your-stories/how-i-learnt-to-focus-on-self-care
--> find a good tailwind ui template for that


donations
  Look at Maryâ€™s meals donation model. And mind etc. Big research - fundamental value add I can make for them.
